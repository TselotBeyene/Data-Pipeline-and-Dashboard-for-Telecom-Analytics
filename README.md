TellCo Telecom Analytics Dashboard

Overview

The TellCo Telecom Analytics Dashboard is designed to provide a comprehensive analysis of TellCo Telecom's operational data, helping stakeholders to identify growth opportunities, optimize network performance, and enhance customer satisfaction. This project delves into four key areas: User Overview, User Engagement, Experience Analytics, and Customer Satisfaction. The dashboard serves as a powerful tool for business intelligence, allowing decision-makers to derive actionable insights from data and implement strategies for growth and profitability.

Key Features

Market Trends: A deep dive into handset usage trends, focusing on dominant players such as Samsung, Apple, and Huawei, as well as user preferences for social media, streaming, and other top platforms.
User Engagement: Insights into user engagement patterns, highlighting how high-engagement users contribute significantly to network traffic and what apps (e.g., YouTube, Netflix) drive the most engagement.
Network Performance: Evaluation of network metrics such as throughput and latency, which directly impact user experience and satisfaction.
Customer Satisfaction: Analyzes satisfaction scores and identifies areas for improvement based on user engagement and network performance.
Strategic Insights & Recommendations

Targeted Marketing for Premium Users: Tailor marketing campaigns specifically for users of high-end devices (e.g., Samsung Galaxy S21, iPhone 13), offering them exclusive data plans and personalized service offerings.
Network Optimization: Invest in infrastructure improvements, especially in regions with high RTT (Round Trip Time), to reduce latency and improve throughput, ultimately enhancing the overall user experience.
Strategic Collaborations: Collaborate with leading app providers such as YouTube and Netflix to offer bundled data plans, exclusive promotions, or partnerships to increase user engagement.
Loyalty Programs: Develop loyalty programs targeting high-satisfaction users to encourage retention. Simultaneously, create tailored solutions to address the needs of low-satisfaction user segments by focusing on pain points and improving their experiences.
This dashboard enables data-driven decision-making by presenting insights on these key areas, helping TellCo Telecom to improve its market position and drive long-term growth.

Installation Guide

Follow the steps below to set up the TellCo Telecom Analytics Dashboard on your local environment:

1. Clone the Repository
Start by cloning the repository to your local machine:

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/TellCo-Telecom-Analytics-Dashboard.git
cd TellCo-Telecom-Analytics-Dashboard
2. Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a Python virtual environment to isolate project dependencies:

python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
3. Install Required Packages
Use pip to install the necessary dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
This will install all required libraries and frameworks for running the dashboard, including data analysis, visualization, and backend tools.

Usage Guide

Once the project is set up, you can run the dashboard and start exploring the analysis:

1. Launch the Dashboard
To run the dashboard, execute the following command in the terminal:

python dashboard.py
This will start the local server, and you can access the dashboard in your browser at the specified localhost address.

2. Explore the Notebooks
The project also includes several Jupyter notebooks that provide detailed analysis and insights:

EDA.ipynb: Exploratory Data Analysis, exploring the key trends and patterns in the dataset.
experience_analytics.ipynb: Analyzing network performance metrics (RTT, throughput) and their correlation with user experience.
new_engagement.ipynb: Detailed user engagement analysis, segmenting users by activity levels and app usage.
overview_analysis.ipynb: General overview analysis of user demographics, handset preferences, and app usage.
postgres_load.ipynb: Instructions for loading raw data into PostgreSQL for easier querying and analysis.
satisfaction_analysis.ipynb: Deep dive into customer satisfaction metrics and the factors influencing satisfaction levels.
users_overview.ipynb: In-depth exploration of user demographics and behavior trends.
These notebooks provide in-depth insights and are essential for understanding the key findings presented in the dashboard.

3. View Data
The data directory contains both raw and processed data files, which are used for analysis in the dashboard. These datasets are critical for performing additional exploratory analysis or refining the existing insights.

4. Database Integration (PostgreSQL)
The project supports integration with PostgreSQL to load, manage, and query large datasets. The notebook postgres_load.ipynb contains detailed instructions for setting up the database and loading raw data files into it. This is particularly useful for users looking to perform custom queries or interact with large datasets.

5. Data Files
The user_satisfaction.csv file located in the Models directory contains key data used in the satisfaction analysis, including user demographics, satisfaction scores, and engagement metrics.
